PhD student at the **University of Grenoble Alpes**, I am interested in *reducing the environmental impact of artificial intelligence*. I have been studying how to precisely measure the energy consumption of machine learning model training.     
    
I graduated in 2021 from the engineering school IMT Atlantique (Télécom Bretagne degree) with a specialization in **Distributed Systems** and a master in **Data Science** from EURECOM.    

During my studies, I have had the opportunity to do several long internships in both small and international companies. I wrote my master's thesis at **Quantum Surgical** on the segmentation of medical images. Then I interned twice at **Google**, first in Messaging and secondly in Cloud. All internships were amazing experiences where I learned how to process and learn from massive sensitive databases, I developed *software engineering skills* and I first managed my own projects. I realized that my *soft skills*, such as presenting my work and networking, were some of my most important strengths.  

Through my travels, I have become highly aware of the impact of climate change which is the reason I am doing research on the impact of digital activities and more precisely of artificial intelligence.    
Outside of work, I love climbing, ski touring & trekking. I have played the transverse flute in a Wind Orchestra for a few years during my previous studies.  

You will find in here my detailed CV and publications.
