I had several occasions to give an overview of existing ressources and present the most recent data on the impact of digital infrastructures:
- My most recent recorded talk was at a Rdatadev meeting. The video can be found <a href="https://scalelite.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/playback/presentation/2.3/23542abd89d4c2d616564be9dfb95099c0ca0f9a-1697528367331">here</a>.
- I also gave a presentation at a summer school, with more details on how we can monitor energy in data centers: <a href="https://www.canal-u.tv/chaines/groupecalcul/anf-ust4hpc2023/monitoring-de-la-consommation-energetique-par-mathilde-jay">recording</a>.
